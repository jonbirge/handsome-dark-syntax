A light easy on the eyes atom syntax theme with minimal amount of highlighting.

## Minimal highlighting, just 5 classes:

1. Strings
2. All statically known constants (numbers, keywords, boolean, etc)
3. Global definitions
4. Standard language keywords (def, if, else, etc)
5. Comments


## Comments highlighting

Comments are clearly visible. I think if there are comments we should see and read them first.

## Contrast:

For good readability text has contrast 6:1 and it is consistent for all colors. Contrast calculated with [HCL color model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_color_space). Secondary color contrast is 2.5:1

## Supported languages

- Clojure
- CSS
- [Elixir](https://atom.io/packages/language-elixir)
- GitHub Markdown
- HTML
- [JavaScript](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel)
- Ruby
